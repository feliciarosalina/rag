Breaking Bad,"(Fair Warning: Spoilers Ahead if you haven't watched previous seasons!)

After a Season Four that may have been one of the greatest single seasons of television I have ever watched, this Fifth Season was clearly going to bring changes. With Gustavo (Giancarlo Esposito) out of the picture, the show was obviously going to have to turn elsewhere for dramatic conflict. Instead of searching for ""another Gus"", however, these eight episode bring the focus back to the morality of the show, and the conflict brewing inside Walter White (Bryan Cranston) himself.

When this show began, it was all about Walt and Jesse (Aaron Paul) just kind of muddling along trying to learn the meth business. Neither had grand designs, and Walt wanted to make ""just enough money"" to get out and support his family. Then, for a couple of seasons, the focus of the show shifts to the cartel and Gus, rendering the morality play to the background in favor of more character drama. With those angles now wrapped up, however, Vince Gilligan made the right decision to re-focus inward.

So, this season is truly about Walter White's internal struggle. Though in the beginning his actions were all about protecting his family, Walter now cannot let go. He is ""the best"" at something and the meth business now defines him. In fact, his family has completely crumbled beneath him, little by little. Skyler (Anna Gunn) views him truly as ""the danger"" and is practically waiting for the cancer to re-appear and kill him, while Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) doesn't have a good relationship with anybody.

Thus, the major theme of this season is that (on multiple occasions), Walt is presented with a series of choices regarding his future involvement in the meth business. His reaction to those choices is what sets up the upcoming final eight episodes.

Of course, the season does not ENTIRELY focus on Walt. Mike Ehrmantrout (Jonathan Banks) has an amped-up role, while Hank (Dean Norris) doggedly pursues the loose ends left by Gus and even makes a startling discovery about Walt.

Overall Season Five is a solid effort in this show's tenure. Why not the full five stars? Because, at least to me, nothing could top the Walt/Gus tension of the previous two seasons. Instead, these eight episodes primarily served as kind of a conduit through which the show can reach an organic conclusion. The show was all about morality and choices in the beginning, and that is apparently how it will also end.

""Breaking Bad"" started off as a show about family, morality, and hard choices. Over its six year run, it branched out to include the grittier aspects of the drug cartels. For the final eight episodes, Vince Gilligan swings the show back to its simpler roots, once again focusing on the personal aspects of Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and his family/friends.

This is the part of the review where I would usually go into a few minor spoiler-ish details about the season. I won't do that here, though, because to do so would inherently give a few things away. Suffice it to say, though, that the ""endgame"" does start right away in the first episode of these eight.

A few comments I do have about these eight episodes (and the ending of the show in general...no spoilers):

-This show ends in a way I would have never expected. I know that sounds cliched, but it is indeed the case. It really does focus on the high drama of the characters as opposed to the cartel stuff happening in the middle seasons (which, IMHO, produced the highest drama of the show). I guess I should have expected as such from Vince Gilligan, who never gives you anything predictable.

-The reason for four stars instead of five? Personal preference, mostly. For me, this show was at its peak when it really delved deeply into the ""Gus stuff"" and the cartel drama. After that plot arc was finished, it was almost like the show has to kind of re-invent itself with just 16 episodes to go. Some of the new characters like Lydia (Laura Fraser) & Todd (Jesse Plemons) never quite caught my interest as much as some of the earlier characters.

Overall, though, this is still a pretty dynamic ending to a great show. All the major plotlines are tied-up (there are very few ""loose strings"" in this series), with major characters like Jesse (Aaron Paul), Hank (Dean Norris), and Skyler (Anna Gunn) getting some good character resolution.

Your ultimate enjoyment of the final few episodes, though, will likely be determined by how much you liked the beginning of the show. If you loved ""Breaking Bad"" right from when Walt steps out in his white underwear, you'll have nothing to complain about with this ending. If, like me, it too you a little while to get acclimated to the characters and then really found the show to blossom in the middle years, this ending might feel a tad bittersweet to you.

4.5 stars. Not quite the show's peak, but (at least for me) better than the beginning when the characters were all so strange.",Audience

Chernobyl,"Terrifying and sobering – as exceptional a piece of television narrative as you're ever likely to see

Created, written, and executive produced by Craig Mazin, Chernobyl is directed by Johan Renck as part-horror movie, part-cautionary tale, and part-political treatise. It presents a terrifying, nightmare vision of how bad things can get when hard scientific facts are made subservient to political agendas, and governments strive to undermine not only scientific expertise but the very nature of truth itself (the Soviet Union was a big fan of ""alternative facts"" long before the GOP). Chernobyl begins and ends by asking the viewer to ponder the cost of cumulative nation-wide lies. However, it's just as interested in celebrating the heroes as it is assigning blame.

April 26, 1986, 1:23am; near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR, Reactor No. 4 at the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant explodes, sending out masses of radioactive material. As the Central Committee tries to keep a lid on things, a commission is assembled to investigate the disaster. The commission's head is Boris Shcherbina (a career-best performance from Stellan Skarsgård), Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and a devout party-man. The commission's scientific expert is Valery Legasov (a mesmerising Jared Harris), deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute, who immediately realises that the accident is much more serious than the government are saying.

Thematically, Chernobyl is not subtle. The opening line is ""What is the cost of lies?"", and this issue is front and centre for the entire five episodes. The show presents the Soviet Union as a place where lying and statecraft were one and the same, and in so doing, it illustrates what can happen when institutions of government put political ideology above objective facts, when egotistical politicians disregard everything that experts are telling them in favour of their own ill-informed theories (sound familiar?). The first episode in particular gives us some fine illustrations of a system obsessed with committees, bureaucracy, and secrecy, all built upon an unnecessarily complicated and rigid hierarchy.

However, if there's an overriding mindset amongst the Soviet people, it's a sense of civic duty, borne of a genuine belief in socialism and total trust in the Central Committee. Not all characters share this trust, but enough of them do to make it a trope. And for the most part, the show presents this sense of duty to the State as deeply honourable, worthy of a great deal of respect. How the State elicits, manipulates and exploits these feelings is being criticised, not the feelings themselves – a vital distinction.

Aesthetically, Chernobyl opens with the explosion, throwing the audience into the chaos and confusion. However, rather than placing us in the control room at the moment of the explosion, we see it through the closed window of a character who doesn't even notice it happening until the shockwave hits a couple of seconds later. It's a wholly unexpected way to begin, presenting a massive real-life disaster not from the perspective of spectacle, but from a subjective human perspective. This immediately sets up the show's interest in people. The helicopter crash seen in the trailer is shot the same way - focusing on human reactions to the crash rather than the crash itself.

As for the cinematography generally, Jakob Ihre shoots everything unfussily, with no real visual gymnastics. However, there are still moments of stark beauty and great artistry. The second episode ends with a dialogueless scene that Michael Mann would be proud of and also features perhaps the single most extraordinary shot in the series – a high elevation shot of Pripyat looking down at the residents being evacuated onto a fleet of buses. In the background, the power plant can be seen still burning, whilst the people and the plant are bifurcated by the flats in which they used to live. This is as good an example of thematic photography as you're likely to find.

As for problems, well, the characters are a little too black and white – the 'good' characters are practically saintly, and the 'bad' characters are almost pure evil. And there's not a lot of ground in between.

At its core, the show is most interested in what happens when governments stop listening to science, when every smart person in the room is telling a leader one thing, and he or she decides to ignore it based on nothing other than ideology or ego (and yes, Trump's attitude to the ever-worsening global climate crisis is very much the target). An exceptional piece of television in pretty much every way, Chernobyl is as terrifying as it is compelling, as heartbreaking as it is eye-opening.

And all of this is not even to mention the dogs. I'm just not ready to talk about the dogs.",Audience

Foundation,Raych Seldon who's supposed to have a daughter who founds the second foundation and dies during a revolt defending his university and students on Santanni... Now he just murders Hari. The entire 2 books dedicated to why Hari adopted him and how deeply they care for each other is thrown away and now Hari is basically a child kidnapper and home wrecker.   Nothing is the same.  How do they possibly recover anything from here.,Audience
Foundation,"For anyone who has enjoyed the seminal books, this will be a massive disappointment. But not for the reason most adaptations don't work, but because it shares almost nothing in common with the original stories.

It was always a tough task trying to adapt something spanning millennia, but the attempts at character development are clumsy - bar the Empire clones, that actually do a good job of personifying the decline.

Visually stunning and a couple of good actors, but overall pretty poor.",Audience
Foundation,"Not sure why everyone's hating on this show.  Granted I've never read the source material but I have read a lot of golden age science fiction, and am a big fan of sci-fi.  I think next to the expanse this is the best show of the genre currently on TV and I couldn't be happier to have so much sci-fi content to choose from these days.  It is a beautiful show, very well acted and certainly better then Star Trek discovery.",Audience
Foundation,"its awesome, we need this kind of sci fi show",Audience
Foundation,"Yes a bit slow at the beginning. Wasnt that the same with expanse? This is the complete galaxy as stage. Just like Gaal we come from a backwater planet. Most certainly we are a little bit confused and stunned by the sheer scale.

And yes, directional work and/or cutting are a wee bit off with the timing, sometimes just too much in love with the great visuals, sometimes too slow when too little happens, sometimes too hasty when it should stay with the characters. 
Some might perceive this as difficulty to connect to the show or the characters.
But actually not so much of a problem for me. 

I really love the show for its story which will unfold no less than a plan to save mankind. Not with a lucky shot at the unprotected reactor. More like shortening the middle ages after the decend of the Roman empire. 
The greatest plot of all. And this will take a little time and a few episodes to catch on.",Audience
Foundation,"Massive, impressively beautiful and smart.",Audience
Foundation,completely unwatchable,Audience
Foundation,"Dull, uninspiring. With the exception of the Empire, all other characters were dull, predictable, and irritatingly whiny.",Audience
Foundation,"They've thrown the Foundation books in the bin and taken a dump on them. Very disappointing. This show has nothing to do with the source material except for the character names. They have chosen to directly contradict core concepts from the source material, for example:
'Hari Seldon said the whole galaxy can pivot around a single individual!' - no he didn't, he said the exact opposite. Psychohistory only predicts the movements of societies, not individuals. It isn't magic.
'Violence is the last resort of the incompetent' - nah, screw that. More violence say the showrunners.
Why call your tv show 'Foundation' if you hate the books so much that you ignore them?",Audience
Foundation,I loved it. Not as faithful to the source as I want but good enough.,Audience
Foundation,"I'd like to find the rolled edition of The Foundation series written on perforated pages the screenwriters used.  I wonder if it was 2 or 3 ply?  It's a decent science fiction series but ignores many of the major principles in the books.  Asimov's famous rules of robotics are ignored.  Using your mind to avoid wars is mostly ignored.  It strays too far from Asimov's principles for my taste.  That said, I'll keep watching the series because it is an interesting science series.",Audience
Foundation,"Visually sumptuous with incredible production value, what could have been a masterpiece is woefully let down by abysmal acting and excessive Mary-Sue implementation. Two of the primary characters bring the whole show down. Gaal Dornick (Llobell) is nothing but a perpetually whiny teenager in this adaptation The legendary Salvor Harden is portrayed by Harvey who has exactly 2 facial expressions.  angry girl and annoyed girl - no sign of the wisdom or strength of the book's character. 

Stay away.",Audience
Foundation,"When I started watching Foundation, I really had some hope.  Having read the books recently and seeing the first episode, I thought, ""They're going to change some things, but it looks like they may stick to the story.""  How quickly that changed in episode 2.  It totally deviates from the books and not necessarily in good ways.  

The thing about the Foundation books that I always liked is that, for the most part, people used their wits and intelligence to solve problems.  Only in rare cases did they go to their guns or use brute force to solve a problem.  Sadly, in the episodes, it's the complete opposite.  Almost everything is a violent fight and there's very little thought in how problems are solved.  The only possible exception was Day's answer to the priestess who challenged him about his soul.  That showed hints of Asimov's prowess of handling problems in the books gracefully.  Everything else seems like a slugfest or a GOT-like plot twist thrown in to keep you interested.

I think had they named this series something else, I may have liked it more.  With the name of Foundation though, it just falls flat.  I'll probably watch the next season just to see where it goes (and for the really nice CGI and cinematography), but I'm definitely not chomping at the bit for it, which is a shame because I think they really could have done a lot with the material they had from the books.",Audience
Foundation,"The visuals are great, but the story is boring. Read the books instead.",Audience
Foundation,"I think that it is a very good series. Nevertheless, I only find the story of the ""Empire"" clones as the most interesting. The Terminus story do not seem as it is going to somewhere. Maybe we need to wait a little further in order to find some sort of connection.",Audience
Foundation,"If you like palace intrigue and love scenes you might like this show. If you like Foundation and were hoping to see an adaptation of it don't waste your time.

This show might be less confusing if they removed the Foundation branding and sold it as an original story but it would still be slow, somewhat incoherent and ultimately disappointing.",Audience
Foundation,Too much mathematics and not in a fun way like The Big Bang Theory. Heavy show to watch.,Audience
Foundation,"I have watched 5 episodes and still wonder when they are going to get around to Azimov's story.   Way too much deviation from the original, almost unrecognizable.",Audience
Foundation,"Very aesthetically pleasing. But you have to put it on mute, and pretend that it's not based on Asimov's Foundation. I would be OK with a deviation from the source material, but they handled the source material with little respect. The laundry list of terrible decisions they made is just much too long: their misunderstanding or disregard of what psychohistory is vis a vis the role of the individual, making certain characters nonsensically religious, way too much drama, way too much star-wars-ification of the source material... The foundation team would do well to look at how the new Dune movie was respectful of its source material, and was better for it.",Audience
Foundation,"If the series is passionate about anything, it's the uplifting clarity of science and math... One scene starring Gaal is a literal math montage that's as sensual as anything that happens in bed.",Critic

Loki,"I watched Loki the way I hadn't watched the series for a long time - as it came out, I was so curious what would be shown on the small screens about one of the main Marvel characters, and not about the background third-rate ones. And after a promising start to the series, I was still afraid that it would become the same disappointment as WandaVision, and there were prerequisites for this, but, fortunately and surprisingly, everything worked out. This is Marvel's best project since Endgame - unusual, fresh, stylish, fantastic (somewhat reminiscent of Rick and Morty in terms of sci-fi, which is not surprising, because they share a screenwriter) and original.

Based on the confessions of the creators, the inspiration for this series was, in addition to the mentioned Rick and Morty, the films Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Metropolis and Watchmen - and it really feels a little - A little of all of the above.

I can note minor shortcomings, perhaps, a little sagging in the middle, a bit of a story (but now nowhere without it) and a too broken end, making you wait for either the second season, the announcement of which is already in the credits of the last episode, or new films in which the pledged intrigue in the last episode. Loki is not a complete story at all, but just another plot to something more, as Marvel likes to do. However, this something more is of genuine interest, so I don't even mind!

That's the kind of Marvel universe I like to see - continuing to grow and surprise. After the Final, I thought that they would not jump any higher, but now there are chances - I foresee a big epic in phase 4 related to the multiverse. I can't wait for the second Strange - there it should pour out in full. Loki is the best Marvel series so far.",Audience
Loki,"Loki is a joke in his own show. Cold blooded murderer who almost conquered the Earth minutes earlier shifts into crying, clumsy husk of a beta male in a matter of one scene. Besides that the show is just boring and Sylvie's motives are one of the dumbest you can really come up with.",Audience

Moon Knight,best disney marvel show,Audience
Moon Knight,"This might be one of the best things Marvel has ever put out. For the first time in a long while (in Marvel movies), I actually felt sympathy for the characters. They feel like real people. The actors do their characters so well. I love how it's breaking the usual Marvel formula and doesn't tone down the violence/action. This show isn't the usual Marvel superhero comedy, it's something new. And I appreciate them for not holding back on Moon Knight like they've held back on the majority of their Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall, this show is probably my favorite piece of Marvel content ever. No questions asked.",Audience
Moon Knight,The first episode is really stunning and I'm looking forward to seeing how the story connects with the entire Marvel Universe.,Audience
Moon Knight,A Worthy watching masterpiece,Audience
Moon Knight,"With a great performance from Oscar Isaac, a compelling story that, with no pre-established characters to call upon when the going gets tough, is less likely to be spoiled easily like the other Phase 4 Marvel shows, the same great cinema-worthy production values, a darker tone and even fairly solid action whenever we are given it, Moon Knight, the first MCU show since 2018 to star characters who weren't introduced in the movies (not counting the unambiguously non-canon Helstrom), the best Disney+ MCU TV show to date...in my humble opinion at least :)",Audience
Moon Knight,Although this character is a new face to many viewers and is a bit chaotic they truly represented this character well. This whole season was beautifully written and acted out perfectly. I have no complaints just that they could've had two more episodes at least to really expand on the Marc Steven and Jake Lockley story. As well Harrow deserved a more detailed back story for us to understand his character. The last episode was just a bit rushed too. Besides that I think the show was amazing.,Audience
Moon Knight,"Brilliant show ,Marvel is able to elevate the show to whole new level, depiction of Cairo , finally properly depicted by Hollywood,thank God for no yellow filter. Love Steven and Marc's dysfunctional sharing of the same body, Layla is great as well.",Audience
Moon Knight,"If the finale has been a bit of a let down for me, I really enjoyed the Moonknight. As in Loki and WandaVision, the focus has been more on interesting characters development and I really liked how they exploited the theme of sanity and mental illness. Just expect a big out of place CGI battling in the end and an some loose thematic ties that don't quite fit. Overall, I had a very good time!",Audience
Moon Knight,"I just watched the premiere episode of Moon Knight.

I enjoyed it! Full disclosure: I'm aware of the character, but I've never really followed his exploits in the comics, beyond a few crossovers where he teamed up with other heroes like Spider-Man. 

I am conscious of the fact that this series apparently doesn't directly adapt any comic book story and instead uses the lore to develop a new narrative for live action, presumably to allow for more accessibility to the larger MCU moving forward.

My thoughts:

First of all, the casting is terrific. Oscar Isaac does a tremendous job essaying a man who experiences frequent and terrifying time/location jumps which often end up with him surrounded by bloodied corpses (more on that in a minute).  As Steven Grant, Isaac is funny and smart, but also a plausibly nervous and unstable wreck. That's why it's all the more impressive when the other personality inhabiting his body - Marc Spector - shows up and is revealed to the polar opposite, a cool, calm, deadly mercenary who never loses control.

Equally impressive is Ethan Hawke as a cult leader with the power to grant or take life by holding someone who is steeped heavily in the Egyptian history that provides the supernatural context of Moon Knight. Hawke's character is fascinating in that he's revealed to he surprisingly conscientious, even empathetic. But, as was the case with Thanos, he feels the ends justifies the means, up to and including murder. 

The production looks terrific - I think this may be the most cinematic of the Marvel live action films to date-  and, honestly, I thought it had better special effects than Eternals.  

But what really caught my attention is how far Disney let them push this. There's real violence in this show. I'm talking people being killed and actual onscreen bloodshed. There's a scene involving a log smashing into someone that I was shocked made the final cut.

This is important, because Disney has earned a deserved reputation for sanitizing things to make them more family friendly and you can't really plausibly do that with a character who is established as being willing to kill bad guys. I'm genuinely pleased they went with a more mature approach to the material and I hope it sticks. 

The highest praise I can give episode one is that is has me looking forward to episode two. I'm intrigued and excited about where this is going. The debut does a slick job of handling the chaotic nature of Grant's life dealing with the time jumps while offering a  coherent and straightforward narrative.  The character is confused. The audience is not. I'll also compliment the series on the expert handling of the titular character's first onscreen appearance. It's handled brilliantly and is an exciting , heroic moment that allows the viewer to cheer for him. And, man, I do love that costume.

**** out of ***** I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of this. If the first episode is any indication, this should be quite a ride.",Audience
Moon Knight,it's oscar isaac at his best :D,Audience
Moon Knight,"Moon Knight steps outside the norm a bit from the rest of the MCU while at the same time, still feeling very much like a Marvel offering. This is important for the MCU going forward to prevent fatigue with the franchise. 2nd half of the season is better than the first half",Audience
Moon Knight,The Moon (Knight) is full and here to stay!!!,Audience
Moon Knight,"Amazing series. The characters are so much well written that we didn't even feel for a moment that these are the new characters in the mcu. The storytelling, writing, Oscar Isaac's acting has established him as one of the most prominent and fan favorite character with just 5 episodes. Brilliant!",Audience
Moon Knight,"edit: 3 episodes in review - 3.5/5.
edit: full season rating - 4/5.

The 4th and 5th episodes get better. These episodes finally deliver some unique perspectives on the troublesome past of Marc Spector. 

However, the season finale quickly jumps to a superhero up of the main cast. I honestly have seen enough action like that, and although I don't particularly dislike it, I believe it's not the best part of Moon Knight. The post-credits scene/next season teaser delivers some hope for a better season 2.",Audience

Eddie a sad old copy of Hunter from Metal Lords. We know that the Duffers copied that idea from Weiss, who had the project before. Enough, I can't stand to see so many copies, now that monster type Mumm-Ra or taken from Dragon Ball and the bone-crushing, it's really disappointing. Only improve something in chapter 7, SOMETHING.",Audience

Stranger Things,They killed fvcking Eddie!!!!!!!!,Audience
Stranger Things,"Just when I was forgetting about this show and low on care, they reel me back in. Each season they find a way to top the other and keep the show feeling fresh and exciting. I've been watching since season 1 dropped and only planned on having this on in the background but ended up on the couch pulled in. The stories and homages to late 70s and late 80s movies are maturing with the kids. We're definitely getting likenesses of Carrie, Nightmare on Elm Street and Fast Times here. We're reaching a point in time where it is feasible that we could lose one of our main kids. I found myself checking the show rating a couple of times. I'm not sure that I believe this show is really TV-14. We definitely cross some heavy lines in this season. Regardless, I'm dying to see more.",Audience
Stranger Things,"Amazing first 7 episodes. After the first three seasons, I didn't think it would be much better but that was blown out of the water. The episodes are lengthy but are definitely action-packed and all of the separate storylines have their own problems/issues which makes it even more interesting. Also, the horror aspect is definitely more approached compared to the recent seasons, which adds a new, interesting taste to the show. Episodes 4 & 7 are probably the top two episodes that stand out a lot (they might be the best two episodes of the entire Stranger Things series), just be prepared...",Audience
Stranger Things,What a great first volume!,Audience
Stranger Things,Another successful season with a more interesting and fleshed out villain.,Audience
Stranger Things,"First off, whoever is rating this 4-5 stars, should be ashamed of themselves.  Season 4 got more stars than the previous seasons and that's just BS.  This season was split into 2 parts and let's just say the first part might just be a season of filler episodes all the way through.  The humor is horrible, some of the characters are just super annoying, and it was just all over the place.  I really hope part 2 of season 4 will make up for this horrible and disservice to this franchise.  Of all the seasons I've watched, which I enjoyed the first three, never have I fast forwarded any episode in my life until this season...",Audience
Stranger Things,"I loved the new season of stranger things much action, humor, Entertaining and much more… just loved it 😍",Audience
Stranger Things,"It was better than season 3, but still not as good as the first two seasons. One of the biggest complaints about season 3 was the whole Russian plot, and they continue with the Russian plot in season 4... I did not like the crazed basketball players (major Riverdale red circle vibes), the Russia storyline, and Jonathan, Will and Mike chasing Eleven storyline. I feel like those 3 storylines take away from the mysterious murders taking place in Hawkins. The mysteries, and of course the upside down, in Hawkins in season 4 is great. Everything that took place in Hawkins was pretty great, everything that took place outside of Hawkins could've been scrapped or done differently. Last note, Eddie was a fantastic addition.",Audience
Stranger Things,"Much more dark and scarier version of Stranger Things, and it did it so greatly. Vecna was a great villain for the season, and can't wait to see what volume 2 brings.",Audience
Stranger Things,"Tbh, i loved this season alot. Im so excited for volume 2. Now this season is kind of mature like with actors being grown ups it pretty normal. The thing i like about st is that it is different from any other dark horror sci fi shows. St has its own vibe. We get to see the sci fi horror drama along with the teenage struggles that they have to face. Its unlike anyother show which has its main focus on just the story st has character building their characters have one of the best build up througout the seasons. U cannot hate ay character cuz theyre too good to be hated. I love this show my most fav and will always and forever be. Waiting for v2. Very excited for it",Audience

Stranger Things,Lots of monsters and monster action but it all seems a bit repetitive. Plus there are four plots and locales to of which to keep track. Still fun though.,Critic
Stranger Things,"For every welcome moment of dread and (fortunately) equal moment of comedy, not to mention some cool monsters, there are sequences that remind us of just how much is going on. It’s a lot to remember, but if you’re a diehard, it’s no doubt worth it.",Critic
Stranger Things,"A long, scattered ride that's at times disappointing given its reputation as a streaming blockbuster that's too big to fail. But it is still very much Stranger Things, and reuniting with its characters is enough to make it enjoyable.",Critic

The Haunting of Hill House,Enjoyed the show just had a weak ending,Audience
The Haunting of Hill House,"By far, one of the best, if not the best, piece of work Netflix has ever released. I am a huge horror fan and many horror tv shows and movies fail to produce compelling stories or end off with a cheesy ending. Haunting of Hill House does a wonderful job of giving a great story with a very difficult topic and showcasing grief in a relatable yet scary way. The scares were not cheap and were well executed throughout the entire season. You do not need to be a horror fan to enjoy the depth of the show. If you need something to watch, this is the show. You will not be disappointed.",Audience
The Haunting of Hill House,"I dont scare easy. I am always impressed when a show or movie can creep me out so much that I have to turn on the lights!!

The Haunting of Hill House,"Wow... It's, in my opinion, one of the best horror series I've seen. Amazing story that kept me hooked and no unecessary jumpscares, a very good athmosphere and a lot of attention to detail.",Audience
The Haunting of Hill House,"I waited way too long to watch this.

This tv show came out of nowhere and everyone was recommending it to me back in October. sure enough I waited all the way to December to watch it. wow. why didn't I watch it sooner?

The fact that this show made me cry multiple times just puts it to the top of the list for the best tv show of 2018 + one of the best I have seen.

This story follows the Crain family and their time during and after living at Hill House. While it is a horror show, and there are a few good jump scares, the most interesting part is it's story and thriller aspect of trying to figure out what in the world is going on in this house. Each character have their own demons heightened by the house, and are unfortunately put into circumstances out of their control. It's ultimately how they deal with these demons, each other, and how they chose to live their lives after leaving the house and the effects it had on them throughout the rest of their lives.

This show is so meticulously crafted, every scene, every interaction is interlaced and lined up. Brilliant acting from the whole cast especially Carla Gugino (who as a 90s baby - I know mostly from the Spy Kids franchise) - watching her destruction just breaks your heart.

There are multiple scenes throughout this show with one-takes, the most impressive one is in the episode titled ""Two Storms"" I think the take went on for a good 15 minutes without any cuts. this show just has the perfect directing, writing, casting, and gorgeous sets.

if you were on the fence about watching this - don't be!
it's pure brilliance, 10 episodes, and a really easy yet emotional binge.",Audience
The Haunting of Hill House,"Very good screenplay, direction and great cast.",Audience
The Haunting of Hill House,We Could NOT. Stop. Watching!!! Really well done show; delivers plenty of anxiety producing moments.....,Audience
The Haunting of Hill House,I do not understand why so many people enjoy this show. I love horror films and when I heard people were throwing up and passing out from the show I was excited to see it. I was very much let down by this show. There was nothing remotely scary in this show unless you are creeped out by one ghost and a beetle and it isn't scary. The entire time it was more a scramble of figuring out what timeline we were in and when things were happening than actually getting scared. Between figuring out who was a ghost and a hallucination was frankly exhausting. The whole plot was a mess and all you got to see was the same story 9 times but from different perspectives. One of the worst shows I've ever watched.,Audience

The Haunting of Hill House,"At once veering away any prior adaptation of Jackson's novel and paying tribute to staples of the horror genre, Hill House is an addictive slow burn of a binge that will have you biting your blanket in fear and tiptoeing in the dark.",Critic
The Haunting of Hill House,"Absolutely gripping from start to finish. Give it a few episodes to build, as it's a slow burn.",Critic
The Haunting of Hill House,"The result is deeply creepy but unexpectedly moving, especially in the series' gorgeously paced midsection.",Critic
The Haunting of Hill House,The Haunting of Hill House contains some of the most unforgettable horror imagery in film or television in years.,Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"A miniseries which is able to take the struggels of addiction and mix it with the genius mind of a world champion chess player.

The Queen's Gambit was able to be an award winning miniseries using, what many people would consider, a difficult to understand and even (to some people) boring game. 

This show is great, and shows the struggle of addiction in a great way. Seeing Beth Harmons addictions take control of her is sad yet keeps you interested. 

One of the only things I say, as an avid chess player, is that they should have shown more of the games. It would help some people learn about chess, and keep the chess players completely interested in the game. Although, even if they don't show much of the chess board, the actors are still able to portray each move telling everyone whats happening.

Overall, this miniseries was fantastic and was able to portray addiction in a great way while keeping the shows main story interesting. Although, they should have shown us the chess games as they would've made the games a lot more suspensful.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,Superb in every way!,Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"If you think The Queen's Gambit is a story about chess, you are mistaken. It's about an orphaned <insert random game> prodigy Beth Harmon struggles with addiction in a quest to become the greatest <insert random game> player in the world. I bet you that 90% of people didn't even know how to play chess and yet; still watched it all the same because the editing was immaculate, the story was about the emotional state and journey of the character. Anya's gaze told a thousand story, just by looking at her face; I could feel her emotions, they were real; coming from a real place and that adds a powerful truth to a fictional story.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"I place this up there with ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" as a chess movie I can and will watch over and over again whenever I need a pick-me-up.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"Amazing series. In the hands of a lesser actress it could have been boring, but I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommend. I just wish I knew how to play chess to fully appreciate the strategies...",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,unbelievable great wonderful majestic adorable charming unusual bewitching fascinating ..... anya taylor-joy is a joy to watch.,Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"fantastic writing, directing and acting. well done Allan Scott, this is a masterpiece",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,Refreshing Netflix original!,Audience
The Queen's Gambit,Netflix achieves a check mate with this beautifully created series! great show!,Audience
The Queen's Gambit,The production and Anya are simply sublime. I found the story very engaging although ultimately as a sportsman I know that the final message could encourage unrealistic expectations (no spoilers so won't expand on this).,Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"I'm sorry, I wanted to like it but it was just so boring. Every episode was more or less the same thing, dealing with some heavy subject matter but doesn't ever get gritty enough. Snooze.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"It's well acted, nicely shot but also really boring. And by that I don't mean chess (which is incredibly boring) but the characters who don't come to life over the show's running time. It doesn't help that there aren't any real conflicts either. 
I just spend 6.5 hours watching a girl learn chess and chew pills like they're candy. As an adult, she is so good at playing chess that nothing can stop her. Sure, Elizabeth has to play some opponents twice in order to defeat them. And there are personal losses, too. But nothing in this show feels like there are any stakes for her at all. She just wins and moves on. 
So, why does ""The Queen's Gambit"" feel flat? One example: From one episode to another, Elizabeth just decides to quit alcoholism and pills, in order to win the most important game in her entire life, because she is indestructible. 
After ""Squid Game"", this is the second Netflix show that received massive hype when it came out that disappointed me. And both would be way better movies than tv shows.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"After looking at all 7 episodes, I can undeniably say that ""The Queen's Gambit"" is by far the best original series I've seen since the premiere of HBO's Chernobyl back in 2019.

It is a series that not only completely immerses you in the somewhat complex world of Chess, but also in a story of self-discovery where one, in order to understand and accomplish its purposes in life, must inadvertently go through a series of personal tests that become increasingly difficult to overcome and that involve changing strategies.

Excellent plot development, good character chemistry, impressive cinematography, and a magistral soundtrack. What more can I ask for? Nothing, because everything fit like a glove.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,Fresh. Different. Engaging.,Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"Interesting. Made chess look interesting, not unlike anime series such as Hikaru no Go, Haikyuu!, etc.  Still included some long, drawn out, and unnecessary scenes.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"Marvelous! A chick power movie without the background abuse or overbearing ""hear me roar"" theme. Most bingeable series of all time.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"With 58 Days on the top 10, this has to be the most watched show on netflix this year. It definitly deserves to be",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"Beautifully filmed with strong characters, well interpreted by the cast. A great captivating story",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,Absolutely amazing and brilliantly well done.,Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"I think what I most enjoyed about the Queen's Gambit is how respectful it is of the viewer's intelligence. It tackles just about every major modern talking point in one way or another, but never shouts at you - albeit for one: addiction. I think this was a really clever touch. While many pieces of media are discussing race, politics, and gender (all of which the Queen's Gambit also takes on), addiction is one that is simultaneously demonized and also conveniently ignored and almost celebrated. Things definitely become a tad ho-hum after a major plot point midway through the series, but the finale is very strong and redeem its shortcomings just in time before the story begins to drag.",Audience
The Queen's Gambit,"Taylor-Joy excels in the quiet moments, her eyelids narrowing as she decimates an opponent, her whole body physicalizing angry desperation when the game turns against her.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"That Beth's exquisite, porcelain features remain so remarkably untouched by the scourge of alcohol and drug abuse is one of the few flaws in an otherwise fabulously entertaining tale of how an orphaned girl found herself through the mastery of chess.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"When you start dreaming about chess after watching a single episode, you'll know you're hooked.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"When coupled with its earnest and talented cast and its lush and stunning aesthetics, The Queen's Gambit is easily one of the strongest binge-worthy shows of the fall season.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"Part addiction drama, part rags to riches story just teeters on the edge of intrigue with solid all-round performances, but at times it felt a bit too stretched out to fully achieve a checkmate.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"While the chess matches themselves were exhilarating to witness-yes, they really were-it was the relationships Beth forms throughout the series that truly gave this stunning period piece unexpected soul.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"Just as you feel a familiar dynamic forming, in which a talented woman ends up intimidating her suitors, The Queen's Gambit swerves; it's probably no coincidence that a story about chess thrives on confounding audience expectations.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"Not the best series Iv'e ever seen, but it's really up there. Well-crafted and fun.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,A compelling coming-of-age story that also explores how substance abuse has become such a killer in western society.,Critic
The Queen's Gambit,The series also succeeds in making the cerebral game of chess come alive even for viewers who don't know a rook from a pawn.,Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"You don't have to care about chess to enjoy The Queen's Gambit-though the chess matches are enthralling even for the uninitiated-because the series is stylish, entertaining, and engrossing.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"With excellent pacing and a sure sense of itself out of the gate, The Queen's Gambit is a work of art-riveting, radiant, and simply spellbinding. Like Beth, it triumphs through its devotion to a love of the game.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"It's stylish, eerie and uneven and seems stretched at seven episodes.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,Anna Taylor-Joy is a joy to behold as the prodigy chess player. The series could have been shortened but the overall effect is solid entertainment.,Critic
The Queen's Gambit,Scott Frank varies the progression to the thrilling end with just enough flashbacks in the plot.,Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"It is a show that takes itself so seriously that, when former child actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster turns up dressed like an escapee from the Wild West, you don't know whether it's meant to be funny or not",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"The Queen's Gambit is undeniably sentimental, but I would argue that it's the various ways it holds back that makes it so effective.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"Yes, this is a series about a chess player, but it is more about her journey there and the heavy and deep emotions that take you through the path is what makes this a must-watch.",Critic
The Queen's Gambit,Creators Scott Frank and Allan Scott have managed the impossible here. They have succeeded in turning a story about one of the most docile and unglamorous sports into something truly magical and outstanding.,Critic
The Queen's Gambit,"It's a performance that really grabs the viewer's attention, and which elevates The Queen's Gambit from a reasonable drama series to a truly engaging piece of television.",Critic
WandaVision,This show was extremely disappointing.  99% of the show plays on a nostalgia gimmick by reliving the theme of old sitcoms.  Nostalgia that is hiding how terrible and a waste of time the show is.  There's only seconds of the script that go towards plot progressive.  This show is all stick and carrot making us waste most of the episode on nonsense.  They took two great MCU characters and made them fools.,Audience
WandaVision,A bold and impressively original direction for the MCU's first next chapter. A Shakespearean tragedy. A great dissection of Wanda and her overall loss in having to bear the burden of such grief that she carries with her since losing Vision in Infinity War.  This is as good as any television this year. I am expecting a lot of emmys going towards WandaVision.,Audience
WandaVision,"Don't expect any big reveals for the finale. Disney has been trolling you all season.
The ending was fine. I think I'm having Game of Thrones flashbacks. This is quite a similar feeling.",Audience
WandaVision,"Only 2 episodes in, and this show has proven itself superb. Honestly, does the MCU make anything bad? How do they continue to do it? The consistency is incredible!",Audience
WandaVision,Adequate when judged on its own. When positioned as the first Marvel offering since Endgame? Pretty disappointing.,Audience
WandaVision,"I really love this show so far.  The chemistry between Wanda and Vision is fantastic with great performances, and is a great exploration of their characters, something we didn't get to see as fleshed out in the movies.  I also really dig the sitcom setting they are going for, and the actors as well as producers are doing a great job at creating these realistic feelings of the time periods of the past.  The progressive mystery is also a big part in what is bringing me back each week as soon as the episode comes out.  However, this show isn't for everyone, especially those who are here for the action and epic stories of the movies and not for romance and sitcom style comedy.  The bits and pieces of suspense that have been given likely isn't enough for the regular MCU fan, as to why there are so many negative reviews, but for me this show is almost perfect and is what I never knew I wanted from the MCU.",Audience
WandaVision,"Amazing show, but with a rushed finale that didn't truly conected with the amazing and unique vision that the writers and director gave to the previously episodes.",Audience
WandaVision,"Love the slow build and creepy slips in the first 3 episodes 
if you bailed early watch ep.4 .",Audience
WandaVision,Incredible! A must see!,Audience
WandaVision,"The worst show I've seen in decades.  I spent the entire 2 episodes waiting and hoping it would suddenly get better.  I love the 2 leads, the concept could become great but the direction fell beyond short.  the only reason I'll watch 1 more episode is that I love the lead actors and marvel usually are great but so far the show was lucky I didn't turn it off mid way which I never would do.",Audience
WandaVision,Kevin Feige and company are on a role ever since Endgame. They haven't missed since then that's for sure.,Audience
WandaVision,Being a viewer of this show with a single episode every weekend that it's a must watch for die hard MCU fans 'cuz of the references and the suspenseful beginning and story plot.,Audience
WandaVision,"A great trip through sitcom history that gives Wanda's character much more depth, Kathryn Hahn is AMAZING",Audience
WandaVision,"The first part a typical 50s tv sitcom and if you never pictured who Wanda and Vision was, it wouldn't be boring and you'd listen and watch, if they continue the sitcom plot further it would have become disappointing luckily it was made exciting by some purple magic.",Audience
WandaVision,"So weird, so emotional, and so much more good than anyone expected it to be. What could have been a a standard, straightforward MCU entry is transcended into a beautiful, thoughtful, psychedelic look at love, loss, and superpowers.",Audience
WandaVision,Spoilers! This show may have started out as a 3/5 but every episode seems to get better. The big twist of Fox's version of the quicksilver entering the show has brought tons of humor and the return of Monica Rambaeu has been brilliant. Paul Bettany (Vision) and Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda) deserves awards for this show. 4.8/5,Audience
WandaVision,"Is very predicted and repeats so much the same narrative exploited from the films, 4/10",Audience
WandaVision,thank u wanda for searching for your kids cause dr strange now needs to step in and thus giving us dr strange 2. amen,Audience
WandaVision,"This show is off to such a great start. Not only are the sitcom references on point and hilarious, there is a strong sense of unease and creeping tension, layered in with subtle hints... check out the label of the wine bottle, Maison du mepris (House of M???) and the name of Agnes (Ag-atha Hark-ness?) and her rabbit Senor Scratch (aka Mr Scratch)...",Audience
WandaVision,"Combines the best of sitcoms and the creepiness of the Twilight Zone. Absolutely loved it! It is not at all the traditional Marvel way of doing things, but I am absolutely craving more.",Audience
WandaVision,"A disorienting tribute to TV sitcoms and, ultimately, a delightfully weird launching pad for Marvel's next era.",Critic
WandaVision,WandVision works best precisely because it is unlike anything the MCU's model has ever produced before.,Critic
WandaVision,"All good things come to those who wait, and the Marvel Universe has always been as much about character and story-build as relentless fighting, and WandaVision shows that there's still more to be found in its almost bottomless bag.",Critic
WandaVision,"Addressing pandemic-induced topics such as loss, grief, and mental illness, Marvel's WandaVision serves as a metaphor for life in the time of COVID.",Critic
WandaVision,"Slow build & stranger than Dr. Strange, but the chemistry between Bettany and Olson, & ambitious original sitcom will have you utterly Scarlet Be-witched. It's the weird reality TV escape we didn't know we needed in 2021.",Critic
WandaVision,The first major Marvel Studios project to release onto the new mega streaming service Disney+ fulfilled big expectations and then some.,Critic

WandaVision,"The new series set after the events of Avengers: Endgame is the most unexpected, fascinating project Marvel Studios has brought to the screen so far.",Critic
WandaVision,"Despite some fun performances, Stark Industries cameos, and a hefty homage to past generations of television, it's tiresome... Slightly confounding expectations become the quicksand here.",Critic
WandaVision,WandaVision is doing a great job of expanding the magical world of this fictional universe.,Critic
WandaVision,"While a slow burn on the mystery could be disappointing, WandaVision is likely to remain highly watchable thanks to its titular duo. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are an absolute joy, and effortlessly emulate the performance styles of yesteryear.",Critic
WandaVision,"Brimming with assurance, the television series is a concoction of risk that pays off.",Critic
WandaVision,"It's hard to find fault in the construction of WandaVision, at least not after three episodes.",Critic

WandaVision,A highly unique and entertaining pivot for the MCU. A delightful sitcom showcase for Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany with a curious and somewhat chilling mystery afoot.,Critic
WandaVision,"I've really enjoyed Wandavision, a series with which Disney makes it clear (if it didn't already with The Mandalorian) that Disney+ original content will be just incredible [Full review in Spanish]",Critic
WandaVision,Part of WandaVision's strength is that it would work just fine as an absolutely straight-up sitcom.,Critic

Forget the fan boys and their reviews..this was so much more than a sequel...fantastic story that came together and answered everything while teasing more....",Audience

Watchmen,"an astonishing representation of the comic vibe of watchmen, set 30 years after the original graphic novel series, a must watch",Audience
Watchmen,"HBO has another winner!

Each episode is better than the next.  The dialogue is sharp, witty & uncompromising.  It's satirical of the human condition & hopeful at the same time with colourful characters, excellent ensemble acting, wonderful art direction.  

Masterful story-telling in a sci-fi/superheroes-fantasy setting.  Thank you Damon Lindelof for lifting the post-GoT blues.

Can't wait for the first season's finale next Sunday...

Watchmen,Hope it gets better. It felt weak for a first episode.,Audience
Watchmen,"I think this is the best tv show I have watched in 2019.  Acting, Cinematography, Plot is all top notch.    Sad it is getting review bombed by certain members of the audience,  its too bad we aren't past that type of stuff yet.",Audience

Watchmen,This is not watchmen...... what the hell is this?,Audience
Watchmen,Why would you ruin this classic? Please stop ruining great franchises. I quit after 2 episodes and canceled HBO right after.,Audience
Watchmen,"So, far, so good! Intriguing storyline which uses an ""massacre"" of black people that happened in Tulsa, 1921 as the basis for the story. Clever, deep and controversial this TV show. Anytime you discuss race there will be people who (for political reasons) will think of it as trash. But this is hard hitting social issue material acting brilliantly by  Regina King and a equally impressive supporting cast. And although fans of the graphic novel and the movie don't like the reimaging of the storyline, It is still great TV.",Audience
Watchmen,The show almost nailed it until the last episode it had weak writing compared to all the episodes,Audience
Watchmen,"1 episode in, and it is great so far.",Audience
Watchmen,This has nothing to do with watchmen.  Like a cheap imitation cheese.,Audience
Watchmen,"Well where do I begin? I can't believe the critics loved it so much.   I really really wanted to like this show.  actually I really wanted to love this show but it was so monumentally disappointing.  

I could see most of the surprises coming a mile away.  The social message of the season was fine but after. Being beaten over the head with it over and over.  It lost any impact and actually had me questioning my liberal sensibilities.  Dr Manhattan  was not believable at all. He was nothing like the original character.  Lady tru was a bore, so obviously adrian's daughter.  I watched the first episode and thought wow this could be good.  It's not the greatest tv I've seen but its got something here to build on.  It just went further and further downhill from there.  Especially with the heavily integrated WTF moments.  I give it two because I liked the angela abar character and looking glass was ok but those were the only two characters I cared about at all. The other thing I can say is it was shot beautifully.  That being said.  I hope we don't get another season of this pathetic attempt to build on Alan Moores epic characters.",Audience

Went in with the knowledge of some bad reviews etc, no clue what they are based upon. Good stuff from beginning till end.",Audience

Watchmen,"Mercifully, the resulting drama... is nothing short of a triumph.",Critic
Watchmen,"A phenomenal cast, fantastic stunt choreography, and a societal and historically relevant narrative which is compelling enough to encourage more. While there may be commentary on The Comedian here, Watchmen on HBO is anything but a joke.",Critic
Watchmen,"Watchmen is a tour-de-force, no doubt, but there's a landing that definitely needs to be stuck.",Critic
Watchmen,"Its greatest rewards are the strength of its perspective, the depth of its humanity, and the risky creative swings it takes to create an entirely new story that also feels right at home in the world of Watchmen.",Critic
